This demo should have Nao picking up your intent and replying according to your trained agent using dialogflow.

IMPORTANT

First, you need to obtain your own keyfile.json from Dialogflow and place it in a location that the code at line 41 can load.
How to get a key? See https://socialrobotics.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CBSR/pages/2205155343/Getting+a+google+dialogflow+key for more information.

Second, the Dialogflow service needs to be running:

1. pip install social-interaction-cloud[dialogflow]
2. run-dialogflow
